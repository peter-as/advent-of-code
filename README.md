Advent of Code is a yearly game starting on December 1st, where participants are able to solve daily puzzles to help save Christmas. Between 2015 and 2024 there were 25 days of puzzles (50 total), but starting from december this was decreased to 12.

I solve every day's challenge in Python, which I upload to this repository. Any language may be used to participate, as you only need to submit your result.
Every user has their own input to the puzzles, which I will not be uploading, since the creator has asked everyone to refrain from doing that.
